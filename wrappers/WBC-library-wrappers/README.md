# WBC-library-wrappers

Wrappers of the [whole-body-controllers library](https://github.com/robotology/whole-body-controllers/tree/master/library). They require the original library to be visible in the Matlab search path: see also [WBC README](https://github.com/robotology/whole-body-controllers/blob/master/README.md#installation-and-usage).

## Methods list:

See the description inside each **original** WBC function for more details.
